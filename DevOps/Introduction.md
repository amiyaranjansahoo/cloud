## What is DevOps
```sh
DevOps is a combination of tools which enables IT organizations to release new softwares features into production faster. 
DevOps helps organizations to innovate faster.
```

## Before DevOps was Adapted
```sh
We used to have either 6 months or 12 months release.
In SDLC (Waterfall Model)
  Requirement Gathering (20 days)
      Analysis (10 days)
          Design (25 days)
              Development (90 days)
                  Testing (60 days)
                      Release
```
## DevOps Practices
#### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)
```sh
      Take the integrated code
      Build the code (compile, test)
      Send immediate feedback about bugs (Using email or communicator)
```

#### 2. Continuous Delivery (CD)
```sh
      helps is automating the deployments to production
      Approval is required to release to production
```
#### 3. Continuous Deployment 
```sh
      Similar to Continuous Delivery
      Approval is not required

#### 4. Microservices
```sh
      Dividing the big applications into smaller services.
```
#### 5. Monitoring & Logging
#### 6. Configuration Management
```sh
      We use configuration management for automating, patching, software installations, application deployments etc
```
