### What is on-premise?
```sh
It is our own building where we buy own and maintain IT infrastructure.
Suppose we want to run a web application in the cloud
In the above example, we are illustrating IT resources required to run the web application
```
### On-premises issues vs. Cloud Solutions
#### On-Premises Challenges
```sh
-	Scalability: Difficulty in scaling hardware and software quickly to meet demand.

-	Cost: High initial capital expenditure (CapEx) for hardware, software, and maintenance.
-	Maintenance: Regular maintenance and updates are required for hardware and software.
-	Disaster Recovery: Complexity and cost of setting up robust disaster recovery systems.
-	Accessibility: Limited access from remote locations.
```
#### Cloud Solutions:
```sh
-	Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand (elasticity).
-	Cost: The pay-as-you-go model reduces upfront costs and converts CapEx to OpEx.
-	Maintenance: Cloud providers handle maintenance, updates, and patches.
-	Disaster Recovery: Built-in disaster recovery solutions with multiple data centers.
-	Accessibility: Access resources from anywhere with an internet connection
```
#### What is cloud computing?
```sh
-	Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 
-	Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services,
  such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).
```
#### Who should learn cloud computing?
```sh
-	Freshers & Experienced 
-	Yes if you work in different streams like testing, java, .net, mainframes, DBA, or non-IT Students.
-	Education: Any Graduates
```
### What are the Benefits of Cloud Computing? 
```sh
1.	Cost
-	There is no upfront investment; You do not have to spend lakhs of rupees
-	There is no need to maintain data centers
-	Pay as you go, pay per hour or second, and Hour

2.	Maintenance
-	We do not have to focus on infrastructure maintenance.

3.	Flexibility
-	You can get resources instantly when needed and terminate when you do not.
4.	Agility
-	To get resources from the cloud, it is a few clicks away.
5.	Security
-	Cloud computing is highly secure. However, it is a shared responsibility.
6.	Access from anywhere
-	We can access cloud computing from anywhere
```
### Cloud Service Models:

#### → Software as a Service (SaaS)
```sh
-	Software as a Service provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. 
-	In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications.
-	 With a SaaS offering, you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure
    is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software.
-	
-	 A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email where you can send and receive email without having to manage
   feature additions to the email product or maintaining the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.
-	Examples : GMail, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365 and Etc..
```


#### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
```sh
-	Platforms as a service remove the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and
  operating systems) and allow you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. 
-	This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software
  maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.
-	
-	Examples : AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine in GCP
```

#### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
```sh
-	Infrastructure as a Service,  contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provides access to networking
  features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. 
-	Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT
  resources  and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.
-	
-	Examples : EC2 VM’s,   Azure VM’s
```
## Cloud Deployment Models:
### Public Cloud : 
```sh
-	The public cloud makes it possible for anybody to access systems and services. The public cloud may be less secure as it is open to everyone. 
-	The public cloud is one in which cloud infrastructure services are provided over the internet to the general people or major industry groups. 
-	The infrastructure in this cloud model is owned by the entity that delivers the cloud services, not by the consumer.
-	
-	Public Cloud
-	In the public cloud, customers share the data center and other resources.
-	Nothing is dedicated to a specific customer
-	The public cloud is cheaper than the private cloud.

Advantages of the Public Cloud Model

●	Minimal Investment: Because it is a pay-per-use service, there is no substantial upfront fee, making it excellent for enterprises that require immediate access to resources.
●	No setup cost: The entire infrastructure is fully subsidized by the cloud service providers, thus there is no need to set up any hardware.
●	Infrastructure Management is not required: Using the public cloud does not necessitate infrastructure management.
●	No maintenance: The maintenance work is done by the service provider (not users).
●	Dynamic Scalability: To fulfill your company’s needs, on-demand resources are accessible. 
Disadvantages of the Public Cloud Model
●	Less secure: Public cloud is less secure as resources are public so there is no guarantee of high-level security.
●	Low customization: It is accessed by many public so it can’t be customized according to personal requirements.
```
### Private Cloud 
```sh
The private cloud deployment model is the exact opposite of the public cloud deployment model. It’s a one-on-one environment for a single user (customer). There is no need to share your hardware with anyone else. The distinction between private and public clouds is in how you handle all of the hardware. It is also called the “internal cloud” & it refers to the ability to access systems and services within a given border or organization.
Private Cloud
○	The cloud resources are entirely dedicated to a specific customer & Org.
○	It is costlier than the public cloud
○	Customers rarely use the private cloud

Advantages of the Private Cloud Model

●	Better Control: You are the sole owner of the property. You gain complete command over service integration, IT operations, policies, and user behavior. 
●	Data Security and Privacy: It’s suitable for storing corporate information to which only authorized staff have access. By segmenting resources within the same infrastructure, improved access and security can be achieved.
●	Supports Legacy Systems: This approach is designed to work with legacy systems that are unable to access the public cloud. 
●	Customization: Unlike a public cloud deployment, a private cloud allows a company to tailor its solution to meet its specific needs.
Disadvantages of the Private Cloud Model

●	Less scalable: Private clouds are scaled within a certain range as there is less number of clients.
●	Costly: Private clouds are more costly as they provide personalized facilities.
Hybrid Cloud:
-	By bridging the public and private worlds with a layer of proprietary software, hybrid cloud computing gives the best of both worlds. With a hybrid solution, you may host the app in a safe environment while taking advantage of the public cloud’s cost savings. 
-	Organizations can move data and applications between different clouds using a combination of two or more cloud deployment methods, depending on their needs. 
-
```
## -	Hybrid Cloud
```sh
-	It is a mix of public and private & on-premise data centers

Advantages of the Hybrid Cloud Model

●	Flexibility and control: Businesses with more flexibility can design personalized solutions that meet their particular needs.
●	Cost: Because public clouds provide scalability, you’ll only be responsible for paying for the extra capacity if you require it.
●	Security: Because data is properly separated, the chances of data theft by attackers are considerably reduced. 
Disadvantages of the Hybrid Cloud Model

●	Difficult to manage: Hybrid clouds are difficult to manage as it is a combination of both public and private cloud. So, it is complex.
●	Slow data transmission: Data transmission in the hybrid cloud takes place through the public cloud so latency occurs.
