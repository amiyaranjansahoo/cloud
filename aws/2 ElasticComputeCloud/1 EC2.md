## EC2 : (Elastic Compute Cloud)
```sh
1.	Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the
cloud. 
2.	It allows you to create and manage virtual servers, known as instances, on which you can run your
applications.
3.	An instance is a virtual server in the cloud that you can use to run your applications.
4.	Aws Launched Ec2 Service in the year 2006
5.	We are creating servers (VM’s) in the Cloud.
6.	 Each instance type offers different compute, memory, and storage capabilities to meet various workload
requirements.
7. It is called as Elastic Compute Cloud
8. It’s a virtual server in AWS, a server with the operating system of your choice
9. On EC2 we can run any applications like, db, web, etc…
10. EC2 falls under IaaS
11. EC2 provides scalable computing capacity ( you can define your CPU, RAM, disk etc as per your requirement
12. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need
13. EC2 belongs to a specific region ( not a global resource)
14. Under free tier we can run the EC2 for 750 hours 
```

#### To create an EC2 instance, you need the following requirements:
```sh
1.	AMI (Amazon Machine Image): Choose an AMI that serves as the template for your instance. An AMI contains
the operating system, application server, and applications for your instance.
2.	Instance Type: Select the instance type based on your application's resource requirements. Instance types
vary in CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.
3.	Security Group: Create or select a security group that acts as a virtual firewall to control inbound and
outbound traffic to your instance.
4.	Key Pair: Create or import an SSH key pair to securely connect to your instance. This is necessary for Linux
instances; for Windows instances, you can use a password.
5.	Storage: Choose the type and size of storage for your instance. You can use Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) 
volumes for persistent storage or instance store volumes for temporary storage.
6.	Network Settings: Configure networking options such as VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), subnet, and IP addressing.
7.	Tags (Optional): Add tags to your instance for easy identification and management.
```
#### Lab
```sh
1.	Launch Linux Instance in Mumbai Region (Use Amazon Linux AMI)
2.	Connect to the Instance By using ec2 Instance Connect and Create 2 files input.txt, output.txt .
3.	Connect to the Instance By using Mobaxterm and verify Files .
```
```sh
1.	Launch Windows Instance in Mumbai Region 
2.	Connect to the Instance using RDS and create Create 2 files result.txt and answer.txt
3.	Verify Files .
```
