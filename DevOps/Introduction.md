## What is DevOps
```sh
DevOps is a combination of tools which enables IT organizations to release new softwares features into production faster. 
DevOps helps organizations to innovate faster.
```

## Before DevOps was Adapted
```sh
We used to have either 6 months or 12 months release.
In SDLC (Waterfall Model)
  Requirement Gathering (20 days)
      Analysis (10 days)
          Design (25 days)
              Development (90 days)
                  Testing (60 days)
                      Release
```
## DevOps Practices
```sh
1. Continuous Integration (CI)
      Take the integrated code
      Build the code (compile, test)
      Send immediate feedback about bugs (Using email or communicator)
2. Continuous Delivery (CD)
      helps is automating the deployments to production
      Approval is required to release to production
3. Continuous Deployment (CD)
      Similar to Continuous Delivery
      Approval is not required
4. Microservices
      Dividing the big applications into smaller services.
5. Monitoring & Logging
6. Configuration Management
      We use configuration management for automating, patching, software installations, application deployments etc
```
## DevOps Tools
