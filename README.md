### What is on-premise?
```sh
It is our own building where we buy own and maintain IT infrastructure.
Suppose we want to run a web application in the cloud
In the above example, we are illustrating IT resources required to run the web application
```
### On-premises issues vs. Cloud Solutions
#### On-Premises Challenges
```sh
-	Scalability: Difficulty in scaling hardware and software quickly to meet demand.

-	Cost: High initial capital expenditure (CapEx) for hardware, software, and maintenance.
-	Maintenance: Regular maintenance and updates are required for hardware and software.
-	Disaster Recovery: Complexity and cost of setting up robust disaster recovery systems.
-	Accessibility: Limited access from remote locations.
```
#### Cloud Solutions:
```sh
-	Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand (elasticity).
-	Cost: The pay-as-you-go model reduces upfront costs and converts CapEx to OpEx.
-	Maintenance: Cloud providers handle maintenance, updates, and patches.
-	Disaster Recovery: Built-in disaster recovery solutions with multiple data centers.
-	Accessibility: Access resources from anywhere with an internet connection
```
#### What is cloud computing?
```sh
-	Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 
-	Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services,
  such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).
```
#### Who should learn cloud computing?
```sh
-	Freshers & Experienced 
-	Yes if you work in different streams like testing, java, .net, mainframes, DBA, or non-IT Students.
-	Education: Any Graduates
```
### What are the Benefits of Cloud Computing? 
```sh
1.	Cost
-	There is no upfront investment; You do not have to spend lakhs of rupees
-	There is no need to maintain data centers
-	Pay as you go, pay per hour or second, and Hour

2.	Maintenance
-	We do not have to focus on infrastructure maintenance.

3.	Flexibility
-	You can get resources instantly when needed and terminate when you do not.
4.	Agility
-	To get resources from the cloud, it is a few clicks away.
5.	Security
-	Cloud computing is highly secure. However, it is a shared responsibility.
6.	Access from anywhere
-	We can access cloud computing from anywhere
```
### Cloud Service Models:

#### → Software as a Service (SaaS)
```sh
-	Software as a Service provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. 
-	In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications.
-	 With a SaaS offering, you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure
    is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software.
-	
-	 A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email where you can send and receive email without having to manage
   feature additions to the email product or maintaining the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.
-	Examples : GMail, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365 and Etc..
```


#### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
```sh
-	Platforms as a service remove the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and
  operating systems) and allow you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. 
-	This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software
  maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.
-	
-	Examples : AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine in GCP
```

#### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
```sh
-	Infrastructure as a Service,  contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provides access to networking
  features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. 
-	Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT
  resources  and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.
-	
-	Examples : EC2 VM’s,   Azure VM’s
```
