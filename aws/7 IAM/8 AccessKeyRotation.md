```sh
•	Access key and secret access key is required for programming access.
•	We can deactivate and activate again.
•	We can delete and create a new pair as well.
•	Remember when we create a new key pair, always a new secret key and corresponding secret access key gets created.
  Each time new secret key and corresponding secret key gets created.  
•	We can’t delete straight away, we need to deactivate first then delete.
• Go to Users => <user name> => Security credential => Access keys.
Once its created we can see the activity details like when created, when last time used, and if any resources are
linked to this access keys and secret access keys.
