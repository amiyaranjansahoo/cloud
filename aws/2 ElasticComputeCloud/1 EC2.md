## EC2 : (Elastic Compute Cloud)
```sh
1.	Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the
cloud. 
2.	It allows you to create and manage virtual servers, known as instances, on which you can run your
applications.
3.	An instance is a virtual server in the cloud that you can use to run your applications.
4.	Aws Launched Ec2 Service in the year 2006
5.	We are creating servers (VMâ€™s) in the Cloud.
6.	 Each instance type offers different compute, memory, and storage capabilities to meet various workload
requirements.
To create an EC2 instance, you need the following requirements:
1.	AMI (Amazon Machine Image): Choose an AMI that serves as the template for your instance. An AMI contains
the operating system, application server, and applications for your instance.
2.	Instance Type: Select the instance type based on your application's resource requirements. Instance types
vary in CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.
3.	Security Group: Create or select a security group that acts as a virtual firewall to control inbound and
outbound traffic to your instance.
4.	Key Pair: Create or import an SSH key pair to securely connect to your instance. This is necessary for Linux
instances; for Windows instances, you can use a password.
5.	Storage: Choose the type and size of storage for your instance. You can use Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) 
volumes for persistent storage or instance store volumes for temporary storage.
6.	Network Settings: Configure networking options such as VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), subnet, and IP addressing.
7.	Tags (Optional): Add tags to your instance for easy identification and management.

#### Lab
```sh
1.	Launch Linux Instance in N.Virgenia Region (Use Amazon Linux AMI)
2.	Connect to the Instance By using ec2 Instance Connect and Create 2 files input.txt, output.txt .
3.	Connect to the Instance By using Mobaxterm and verify Files .
